# Part 1: Environment & Dependency Management
I created a python environment called **ds_env** using **venv** and installed the required packages following these steps:
1. Create a python environement using: python -m venv ds_env
2. Activate the environment using: source ds_env/Scripts/activate
3. Once the environment is activated, install the packages using pip
4. Create a requirements.txt file using: pip freeze > requirements.txt
5. This file will contain all packages installed
6. Then add, commit and push changes to git
